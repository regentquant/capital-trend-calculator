FIRST TIME SHARING CODE TO OTHERS. WHEN WRITING CODE, DIDN'T REALIZE OTHERS WILL SEE IT. SO DIDN'T ADD COMMENTS TO ALL IMPORTANT PARTS. YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO UNDERSTAND MY CODE TO USE THE CODE. MY APOLOGIES. ðŸ«¶

Code written by @Curry Yao, CEO of Regentquant, CEO of Century KY.

The calculator is used to measure amount of money flowing in and out of a given asset (stock/ETF).

Use second interval to maximize precision. If tick data is available, then use tick data.

ðŸš¨ ONLY USE macromain() and single_day() functions!!!

Main Idea:
1. Downloading data from polygon.
2. Cleaning data. If no trade happens in a given time interval, api provider skips the data. So we have to clean the data. Check code if you want to know what I mean. I apologize for not writing an user friendly code.
3. Calculating. If price goes up, then accum += price * volume * 1; if price goes down, then accum -= price * volume * -1; if price remains same, then accum += 0.

Change max_worker depending on your computing power.


Hope you find this calculator useful.
